== Troubleshooting

=== Payment check endpoints return 500 response

[cols="2"]
|===
| Observer
| `payment-decision-framework` while checking payment fraud

| Possible causes
| `Transaction Monitoring Adapter` is returning a 500 error. This might happen if the transaction monitoring 3rd is
  down. The error handling will be improved when the integration with the 3rd will start.
