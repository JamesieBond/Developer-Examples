| Description
| FAM has no response - FAM failed acknowledge FPSRail request event

| Possible cause
| Issues with Kafka producer

Kafka event is posted event in a format FAM listener is working properly

Other issues with processing Kafka event, details see below

| Actions
|

Check if the FPSRail request event is posted on Kafka(see** Kafka UI** in <<Helper tools>> for existence of messages on a topic)

Check if the FPSRail response event is posted on Kafka, as above

Check if there is any relevant FAM log.
See <<Helper tools>> for log access.

| Possible cause
| Parse exception is thrown when mapping message to internal object for `fraud inbound, outbound or outbound return` payment

Income Kafka message has incorrectly formatted or missing date

| Actions
| Check date format on inbound/outbound/outbound return message for above mentioned Kafka topic. (see** Kafka UI** in <<Helper tools>> for existence of messages on a topic)

  Check if the amount `value` and `baseValue` on inbound/outbound/outbound messages for above mentioned Kafka topic can be converted to double

  Correlate the exception with the latest Fraud inbound\outbound\outbound return payment kafka event received to identify the problematic transactionId.

| Possible Cause

|Issue occurs when calling Transaction Monitoring endpoint
| Actions
|   Check FAM response, if it is **400** <<_issues_with_bad_request>> then check payload, there is probably a missing field in the payment request;

Check Transaction Monitoring system connection; https://confluence.10x.mylti3gh7p4x.net/display/SM/Transaction+Monitoring+Adapter+-+Runbooks[Transaction Monitoring Adapter Runbook]

Check other Transaction Monitoring system possible connection issues
